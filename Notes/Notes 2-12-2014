S could have acted differently iff there is a logically possible world in which:
  1. The past of W matches the past in the actual world exactly.
  2. At W, a miracle takes place at the relevant time (after that the conditions continue to apply).
  3. The miracle is localized in the subjects brain and leaves her psychological profile intact.
  4. The result of the miracle is that the subject makes a different decision and because of that decision acts differently.

If S could have acted otherwise then S acted freely.
